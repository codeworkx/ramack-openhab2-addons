The default refresh is set to 1 second. So it polls the switch for status changes.
If you don't use the switch manually often, you can set it to a higher refresh.
The refresh is only relevant to detect manual using the switch.
Switching via openHAB activates the switch directly.

* Switch On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

### RE370K AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender with Smart Plug

* Switch On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

## Prerequisites

Before using Smart Plugs with openHAB the devices must be connected to the Wi-Fi network.
This can be done using the TP-Link provided mobile app Kasa.

## Discovery

Devices can be auto discovered in the same local network as the openHAB application.
It's possible to connect to devices on a different network, but these must be added manually by ipAddress.
It's not possible to connect to devices on a different network using `deviceId` as configuration.

## Thing Configuration

The thingId is the product type in lower case. For example `HS100` has thingId `hs100`.

The thing can be configured by `ipAddress` or by `deviceId`.
If the one of them is used the other is automatically set by the binding.
When manually configured it's preferred to set the `deviceId` because if the ip address of the device would change this will be automatically updated.
Using a configuration with `deviceId` depends on the discovery service of the binding.
The binding supports background discovery and this will update the ip address in case it changes within a minute.
With background discovery disabled the ip address, which is needed to communicate with the device, needs to be set by starting a manual discovery.
It won't update the ip address if background discovery is disabled and the ip address of the device changes.
Manually starting a discovery can also be used to set the ip address directly instead of waiting for the 1 minute background discovery refresh period.

The thing has the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| deviceId           | The id of the device.                                                       |
| ipAddress          | IP Address of the device.                                                   |
| refresh            | Refresh interval in seconds. Optional, the default value is 30 seconds.     |
| transitionPeriod   | Duration of state changes in milliseconds, only for light bulbs, default 0. |

Either `deviceId` or `ipAddress` must be set.

## Channels

All devices support some of the following channels:

| Channel Type ID  | Item Type | Description                                    | Thing types supporting this channel                             |
