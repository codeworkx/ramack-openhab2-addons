# Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

Google Cloud TTS Service uses Google's Cloud Text-to-Speech API to convert text or Speech Synthesis Markup Language 
(SSML) input into audio data of natural human speech. 
It provides 30 voices, available in multiple languages and variants and applies DeepMind’s groundbreaking research in 
WaveNet and Google’s powerful neural networks. 
The implementation caches the converted texts to reduce the load on the API and make the conversion faster.
